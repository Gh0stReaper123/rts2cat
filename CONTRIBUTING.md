## Contribution guidance

This repo uses a Fork / Branch Workflow. If you would like to contribute to the project please use the following guides:

[help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

[help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/](help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

I only accept a Pull Request to the "dev" Branch. It is preferred that any major changes use their own separate branch with the naming convention Feature_

Finally the "master" branch is the latest release and considered production
